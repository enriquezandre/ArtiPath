# ArtiPath: Automated Thyroid Cancer Detection from Histopathological Images with YOLOv8 & Streamlit
This repository contains the web application for our thesis entitled "ArtiPath: Automated Thyroid Cancer Detection from Histopathological Images." ArtiPath leverages YOLOv8 for object detection within histopathological images and Streamlit for the development of a user-friendly interface. The application offers a comprehensive solution for the detection of abnormal cells in thyroid tissues. Users can upload histopathology images and videos, or directly connect a camera or microscope to their computer for real-time analysis.
